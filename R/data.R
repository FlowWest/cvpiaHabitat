A Battle Creek scaling factor of 147\% was calculated as the average ratio of Battle Creek monthly mean flow to Deer Creek monthly mean flow between December and June. This scaling factor was applied to Deer Creek flows and corresponding floodplain area per river mile values, which were then multiplied by the 5.87 mile low gradient mapped rearing extent in Battle Creek. Remote sensing analysis of aerial photography was used to confirm differentiation between instream (active channel area of 52.4 acres) and floodplain inundation area.

#' @section Fall Run Modeling:
#' No site-specific hydraulic modeling was available for this watershed. A flow to floodplain area relationship was generated for this watershed by scaling the flow to floodplain area relationship for Cottonwood Creek  based on hydrologic and geomorphic analyses. Flows and corresponding floodplain areas per unit length were calculated for this watershed as 0.21 percent of Cottonwood Creek values based on the ratio of mean flow from December to June between this watershed and Cottonwood Creek. Of the entire mapped 8.00 mile rearing extent in this watershed, 8.00 miles were classified as low gradient and -0.00 miles were classified as high gradient based on a geomorphic analysis. A scaling factor of 0.1 was  applied to the area per unit length for the high gradient extent. No scaling factor was applied to the low gradient extent.
#' @section Spring Run and Steelhead Modeling:
#' No site-specific hydraulic modeling was available for this watershed. A flow to floodplain area relationship was generated for this watershed by scaling the flow to floodplain area relationship for Cottonwood Creek  based on hydrologic and geomorphic analyses. Flows and corresponding floodplain areas per unit length were calculated for this watershed as 0.21 percent of Cottonwood Creek values based on the ratio of mean flow from December to June between this watershed and Cottonwood Creek. Of the entire mapped 17.92 mile rearing extent in this watershed, 8.00 miles were classified as low gradient and 9.92 miles were classified as high gradient based on a geomorphic analysis. A scaling factor of 0.1 was  applied to the area per unit length for the high gradient extent. No scaling factor was applied to the low gradient extent.

#'
#' @details
#' Estimates of percent pools were provided by Mark Gard for some watersheds.
#' The mean percent pools, excluding Feather River, is 23.1\%. This value is used for watersheds without an estimate.
#' The total area of pools is then caluculated
#' by multiplying the estimated percent pools by the total channel area. Channel
#' areas were estimated using Google Earth Engine.
#'
#' Watersheds With Estimated Percent Pools:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Antelope Creek
#'   \item Battle Creek
#'   \item Butte Creek
#'   \item Clear Creek
#'   \item Cottonwood Creek
#'   \item Deer Creek
#'   \item Feather River (*80% percent pools seems high, but was confirmed by Jason Kindopp)
#'   \item Mill Creek
#'   \item Mokelumne River
#'   \item Stanislaus River
#'   \item Tuolumne River
#'   \item Upper Sacramento River
#'   \item Yuba River

#' \strong{Note:} The area of pools that covers both the Upper Sacramento and

#' Steelhead Adult Rearing Habitat
#'
#' @description A dataset containing adult rearing habitat quanities in square meters
#'
#'
#' @format array[watersheds, months, years]
#'
#' @details
#' Only 5 of the watersheds have wua relationships:
#' **Adult Trout**
#' 1. Battle Creek
#' 2. Butte Creek
#'
#' **Steelhead**
#' 3. Merced River
#' 4. Tuolumne River
#' 5. Yuba River
#'
#' These watershed's habitat values vary by month.
#'
#' For the other watersheds, we created one habitat value using the calsim mean flows for the years 1980-1999.
#' We used Merced's adult steelhead wua curve and scaled it by the ratio of mean flow December through May
#' between itself and Merced.
