\section{Fall Run Modeling}{

A 8.74 mile portion of the entire mapped rearing extent of 15.05 miles was modeled using Central Valley Floodplain Evaluation and Delineation (CVFED) HEC-RAS hydraulic model. Of the entire mapped rearing extent, 15.05 miles were classified as low gradient and 0.00 miles were classified as high gradient based on a geomorphic analysis. Floodplain area per unit length was determined for the modeled extent and applied to determine areas for the non-modeled extent. A scaling factor of 0.1 was applied to the area per unit length for the high gradient extent. No scaling factor was applied to the low gradient extent.

\section{Spring Run and Steelhead Modeling}{

A 8.74 mile portion of the entire mapped rearing extent of 23.84 miles was modeled using Central Valley Floodplain Evaluation and Delineation (CVFED) HEC-RAS hydraulic model. Of the entire mapped rearing extent, 15.05 miles were classified as low gradient and 8.79 miles were classified as high gradient based on a geomorphic analysis. Floodplain area per unit length was determined for the modeled extent and applied to determine areas for the non-modeled extent. A scaling factor of 0.1 was applied to the area per unit length for the high gradient extent. No scaling factor was applied to the low gradient extent.
