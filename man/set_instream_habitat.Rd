\title{Set Instream Habitat Area}
\usage{
set_instream_habitat(watershed, species, life_stage, flow, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{watershed}{one of the watersheds defined for the SIT model}

\item{species}{one of 'fr' (Fall Run), 'sr' (Spring Run), or 'st' (Steelhead)}

\item{life_stage}{life stage of fish, one of 'juv', 'adult' or 'fry'}

\item{flow}{value used to determine habitat area}
}
\value{
habitat area in square meters
}
\description{
This function returns an estimated instream habitat area based on watershed, species, life stage, and flow.
}
\details{
The function relies on a dataframe called
\code{\link{modeling_exist}} that contains data on whether the species is present in a watershed
and whether habitat modeling exists.
If a model for the watershed does exist, the function looks up the flow to weighted usable area (WUA) relationship
(e.g. \code{\link{battle_creek_instream}}) and selects the correct WUA for the
given flow, species, and life stage. This WUA is then multiplied by the watershed's
typical rearing habitat extent length (stored in \code{\link{watershed_lengths}}),
to return an estimate of suitable rearing habitat within the watershed.
When additional species modeling is not available, the fall run WUA
values are used (lengths are modified if the habitat extent varies across species).
Also, if there is no modeling specifically for fry, then the juvenile value is used.

\section{Lower-mid Sacramento River}{

The Lower-mid Sacramento River has two nodes, one above Fremont Weir (C134) and one below (C160).
When calculating habitat for the Lower-Mid Sacramento river, calculate the habitat at
each flow node and sum them proportion to the length of stream above and below the weir:

35.6/58 * (habitat at C134) + 22.4/58 * (habitat at C160)


\strong{Regional Approximation:}
When a watershed has no associated flow to WUA reltionship, a regional approximation is made.
First, the mean WUA at the given flow value from a set of similar modeled watersheds nearby is calculated.
Then the mean WUA is multiplied by the river length of the watershed of interest.

Below are the regions (defined by the downstream watershed) that contain
watersheds with unmodeled spawning relationships. The modeled watersheds
used to approximate spawning area for the unmodeled watersheds
are marked with an asterisk.
