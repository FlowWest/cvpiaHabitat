\description{
A dataset containing the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) in square feet per 1000 feet
as a function of flow in cubic feet per second
}
\details{
Some of the Upper Sacramento Rivers' instream rearing habitat have not been modeled.
The rearing WUA values were estimated using the mean WUA at each flow from Battle Creek,
Butte Creek, Clear Creek, and Cow Creek. The spawning WUA values were estimated using the mean
WUA at each flow from Battle Creek, Butte Creek, and Clear Creek.

Spawning Not Modeled:

\itemize{
  \item Antelope Creek
  \item Bear Creek
  \item Big Chico Creek
  \item Cow Creek
  \item Deer Creek
  \item Elder Creek
  \item Mill Creek
  \item Paynes Creek
  \item Stony Creek
  \item Thomes Creek
