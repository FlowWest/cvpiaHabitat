\description{
This function returns an estimated spawning area based on watershed, species, and flow.

This function returns an estimated spawning area based on watershed, species, and flow.
}
\details{
The function relies on a dataframe called
\code{\link{modeling_exist}} that contains data on whether the species is present in a watershed
and whether habitat modeling exists.
If a model for the watershed does exist, the function looks up the flow to weighted usable area (WUA) relationship
(e.g. \code{\link{battle_creek_instream}}) and selects the correct WUA for the
given flow and species. This WUA is then multiplied by the watershed's
typical spawning habitat extent length (stored in \code{\link{watershed_lengths}}),
to return an estimate of suitable spawning habitat within the watershed.
When additional species modeling is not available, the fall run WUA
values are used (lengths are modified if the habitat extent varies across species).


\strong{Regional Approximation:}
When a watershed has no associated flow to WUA reltionship, a regional approximation is made.
First, the mean WUA at the given flow vale from a set of similar modeled watersheds nearby is calculated.
Then the mean WUA is multiplied by the river length of the watershed of interest.

Below are the regions (defined by the downstream watershed) that contain
watersheds with unmodeled spawning relationships. The modeled watersheds
used to approximate spawning area for the unmodeled watersheds
are marked with an asterisk.
