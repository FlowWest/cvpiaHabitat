\section{Fall Run, Spring Run and Steelhead Modeling}{

The entire mapped rearing extent of 45.68 miles was modeled using Central Valley Floodplain Evaluation and Delineation (CVFED) HEC-RAS hydraulic model. Active channel area of 534.20 acres estimated through remote sensing analysis was subtracted from total inundated area to get inundated floodplain area.
